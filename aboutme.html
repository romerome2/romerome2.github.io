        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Let me stop you for a second and tell you a few things about me.</p><br>I grew up in the west indies. I lived in Antigua and Barbuda for 12 years. <br> I like to learn about medince in college. <br>Another thing i like to do is listen to calm and relaxing music like Partynextdoor,Brent Fayiaz and Bryson Tiller etc. <br> Over the summer i took my first trip by myself to guyanna to spend some time with family and friends. Also i'm a huge fan of sneakers i have about 10 to 12 pairs. My favorite pairs are probably offwhite dunks. </p>
